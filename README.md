# Smart Surveillance System

## Description

Human face detection in criminal activities has been a challenging task in image processing and pattern recognition. Our proposed system, a surveillance security camera with Raspberry Pi and IoT, utilizes CCTV for real-time human face recognition and detection. It employs Haar-Cascade algorithm in OpenCV using Python for face recognition and detection. The system sends alerts through Twilio application to you as SMS when motion is detected and checks for recognized faces, unlocking a Solenoid lock which is connected inside door lock, if the face is stored in the database.

## Features

- Real-time human face recognition
- Haar-Cascade algorithm for face detection
- Twilio integration for alerts
- Solenoid lock control via Raspberry Pi
- IoT-based remote monitoring

## Usage

This project is versatile and can be used for:
1. Face detection activities.
2. Door lock system via face detection in homes or small organizations.
3. Real-time face detection with Haar-Cascade classifier for improved accuracy.
4. Extraction of human faces from datasets for identification.
5. Real-time alerting via SMS for known or unknown visitors.

## Technologies Used

- Flask Python framework
- Raspbian OS
- Twilio for SMS alerts
